## Note Tracker Application Work flow

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudheera96/NoteTracker/master/docs/workflow.png)

We can create assignments logs when we open the app. For doing those assignments at a particular time, we can add a remainder alert with the message and also with sound (advanced feature). Even we can share our assignment log with someone. So when we get the remainder alert, we can start the timer to check how long the assignment takes time to complete. Also, After creating an assignment log, we can even add submission date and time.
